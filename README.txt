The scroll bars on the grid can disappear if the user is RDP'ing into LIMS via a 1920 x 1080 laptop w/ display at 150%.
To avoid this, make sure the form is w/n the 1920 x 1080 ratio. The grid will move w/ the form size.

To handle, follow these steps.
1. Set your VS at 100%
2. Set the form size at 960 w x 540 h
3. Set the grid size at 917 w x 379 h
4. Build it on the large monitor (sheesh)

Be sure to test the result on an RDP session to mstr-lwts (from a 1920 x 1080 screen)
